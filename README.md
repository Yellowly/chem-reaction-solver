# chem-reaction-solver

Work in progress chemical reaction solver. A demo from a May 2022 version of this project can be viewed [here](https://yellowly.github.io/githubpagesthing/). 
This current version has a completely revamped lexer (lexical analyzer) which returns the index where possible typos have prevented the code from running, as opposed to crashing the website. Sadly it does not yet work with the website itself yet. 

Considering that I've finished chemistry and am not taking it this year, this project has been put to the side, but I may return to it if I have more time or if one of my friends taking AP chem convinces me to.
